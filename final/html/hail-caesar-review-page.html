            This movie has been receiving a lot of mixed reviews from what I’ve seen and I was initially perplexed as well. I left the movie thinking I would need a second watch before I could even review it but I managed to gather my thoughts on what I’d just seen. It’s hard to give a summary to the plot of this movie. At the center of a series of side storylines is the story of George Clooney’s character Baird Whitlock who has been kidnapped. Josh Brolin’s character Eddie Mannix is a fixer on Hollywood sets whose job is simply to make sure that movies come out on time. Really though he deals with a slew of other problems so the movie doesn’t seem to focus too much on any one storyline. Really this movie is a love letter to the way old movies were made and shows us that the problems with show business then really aren’t much different than the problems today.<br><br>
            This movie was hypnotizing to me but not in a sleepy way. It wrapped me up in the different stories and I felt I couldn’t look away from the screen. There was just enough absurdity that it almost felt like a dream but just enough realism to keep things grounded. This is all accented by yet another job well done by director of photography Roger Deakins. The cinematography in this movie is fantastic and the whole look of it was just gorgeous. The movie sets and costuming all took me back to a bygone era of Hollywood in a spectacular way.<br><br>
            I definitely got my education on what the Coen brothers brand of comedy is as well and I quite enjoyed most of it. Some scenes had me howling in laughter while others made me smile and some just weren’t my cup of tea. Lots of characters were very charismatic and the performances in this movie really brought the script to life. Josh Brolin absolutely kills it as the lead in this movie and every side character does great with the screen time they’re given. I especially loved the performance of Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle, the star of the western films being shot who then gets transferred into a more serious acting role. He was incredibly charismatic and was definitely the stand out performance for me. One very slight disappointment I had with the movie was Jonah Hill. He’s in the trailer and on the poster and his part in the trailer made me laugh quite a bit but it’s literally his only part. He’s in the movie for maybe 5 minutes and the only lines he says are his exact lines from the trailer. I would have liked to see him used more in this movie, or at least advertised less.<br><br>
            This movie definitely was not perfect though. There were a lot of narrative issues and the story continually lost focus. There was simply too much going on to keep a tight narrative throughout which isn’t a completely horrible sin since everything that was happening on screen was so good but it did take me out of things a bit and at times even confused me. The tone in this movie was also all over the place. It went from zany to serious to spiritual to dark and back to zany again. The movie is incredibly fast paced though so all these changes flew by at a million miles an hour and it was hard to dwell on it too long which I think worked in the movies favor.<br><br>
            I did have fun with this movie but narrative problems and strange tone kind of threw me off. Definitely worth going to though and I still left satisfied so I’m giving this movie a 3.5/5
