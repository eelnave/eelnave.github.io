        <p id="review"> Since Frozen hit the scene in 2013 everyone has been wondering what Disney would do to follow it up. After such catchy tunes and a wonderful princess story, how do they make something just as good? Disney’s response was to make a movie with less music and make the main character technically not even a princess. Luckily for them it works beautifully and Moana is a wonderful film even with all the Disney clichés present.
            <br>
            <br> Our movie starts with a young Moana being told an ancient myth of a man named Maui stealing an ancient artifact. Now because of his actions the land slowly fills with darkness. As she grows up her father pushes her towards being the next village leader and ensures her that everything is fine. Moana on the other hand wants nothing more than to go and sail the ocean exploring the world. Once she learns an important piece of her ancestry she decides to take to the ocean and stop the darkness herself.
            <br>
            <br> The movie is filled with the typical Disney movie tropes. She has a comedic pet sidekick, she sings a song about her deepest desires, and she has an old wise person who gives her advice. That’s not to say any of it doesn’t work, it’s just that we’ve all seen it before. What Disney lacks in surprises they make up for in excellent story telling though. I was emotionally involved in this movie from start to finish and had an excellent time. This is a film for all ages, not just the little ones.
            <br>
            <br> One of the most important qualities of any Disney princess film is the music and while the quantity may be lacking this time around the same quality is there. Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer of the popular Broadway musical Hamilton, has been brought in this time around and he doesn’t disappoint. The music in this movie has his same sense of rhythm and catchy melodies as any other Disney movies with a nice little hip hop spin.
            <br>
            <br> The animation in this film is also incredibly realistic. A gorgeous ocean landscape surrounded by beautiful islands really left me breathless. Animation has come such a long way and in recent years it has reached a point of being almost unbelievable. A good story combined with catchy tunes and amazing visuals make Moana an incredibly fun ride throughout. It doesn’t change course from any other Disney princess movies so if Tangled or Frozen weren’t your cup of tea this certainly won’t change your mind. Fans of the genre will find plenty to like here though and will leave satisfied. </p>
