				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				Facebook seems to try and be accessible to all but is primarily aimed at the "millenials."<br>
				Ages 25-35 social individuals who like to be out doing things. It provides a great way for those people to <br>
				be with and plan events with their friends. It's organized to be navigated simply and information flows from most recent to oldest.<br>
				The repetition of the navigation bar at the top of the page made it very easy to navigate.<br>
				I think it did facilitate for good mobile browsing. It didn't require any pinch zooming was easily navigatable and I never clicked the wrong thing or ended up at the wrong page.
